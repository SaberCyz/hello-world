# hello-world
This is my first repository at GitHub, I'm so happy ot join this great community.
So, I'm fresh here, and I'm Chinese which indicate my English is poor. And I'm not a student from computer engineering,
my subject is environmental engineering which is far from coding in my university, but I want to learn coding, I have put
a lot of time on learning C++, I really want. By the way, I'm already a master student, 24 years old. OK, that's all
for now.
